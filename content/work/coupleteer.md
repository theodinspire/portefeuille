[Coupleteer](http://coupleteer.theodinspire.com/) is a couplet generator. Using
some natural language processsing techniques, it builds pairs of rhyming lines
in iambic pentameter. The program's vocabulary and grammar were trained form
Shakespeare's plays and poems. The code for the project may be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/theodinspire/coupleteer)
